Excellent question! Let me analyze the current architecture and propose extensions for more complex/varied simulations:

  Current Architecture Analysis

  Current abstractions:
  - BaseAgent - Decides actions based on state
  - BaseEngine - Applies actions, rules, checks termination
  - BaseValidator - Validates actions
  - Turn-based, sequential execution
  - Single global state + agent states

  Limitations for complex simulations:
  1. No spatial/network structure - Agents can't have locations, neighbors, or network relationships
  2. No hierarchical agents - Can't model organizations containing sub-agents
  3. No multi-phase turns - All actions happen simultaneously
  4. No reactive/event-driven behavior - Can't respond to mid-turn events
  5. No agent creation/destruction - Fixed agent set
  6. No environment/resources - No spatial resources, terrain, or shared objects
  7. No partial observability - All agents see full state
  8. No agent communication - No messages, negotiations, or markets

  Proposed Extended Abstractions

  Here are 7 new abstract classes to enable more sophisticated simulations:

  1. BaseEnvironment - Spatial/Network Structure

  class BaseEnvironment(ABC):
      """Abstract environment providing spatial structure, resources, or networks."""

      @abstractmethod
      def get_neighbors(self, agent_name: str) -> List[str]:
          """Get agents neighboring this one (spatial/network)."""
          pass

      @abstractmethod
      def get_local_state(self, agent_name: str) -> Dict[str, Any]: 
          """Get local observable state for an agent (partial observability)."""
          pass

      @abstractmethod
      def update_environment(self, state: SimulationState) -> SimulationState:
          """Update environment-specific state (resources, terrain, etc)."""
          pass

  Use cases:
  - Grid-based simulations (cellular automata, urban planning)
  - Network simulations (social networks, epidemics, supply chains)
  - Resource-based (mining, foraging, territorial control)

    2. BaseLifecycleManager - Dynamic Agent Creation/Destruction   DONE

  class BaseLifecycleManager(ABC):
      """Manages agent birth, death, merging, and spawning."""

      @abstractmethod
      def check_deaths(self, state: SimulationState) -> List[str]:
          """Return names of agents to remove this turn."""
          pass

      @abstractmethod
      def spawn_agents(self, state: SimulationState) -> List[BaseAgent]:
          """Create new agents based on current state."""
          pass

      @abstractmethod
      def merge_agents(self, state: SimulationState) -> Dict[str, List[str]]:
          """Return {new_agent_name: [merged_agent_names]}."""
          pass

  Use cases:

          pass

      @abstractmethod
      def get_phase_agents(self, phase: str, state: SimulationState) -> List[str]:
          """Which agents act in this phase?"""
          pass

      @abstractmethod
      def resolve_phase(self, phase: str, actions: List[Action], state: SimulationState) -> SimulationState:

  4. BaseCommunicationProtocol - Agent Interaction

  class BaseCommunicationProtocol(ABC):
      """Handles agent-to-agent communication and negotiation."""

      @abstractmethod
      def send_message(self, sender: str, receiver: str, message: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
          """Send message from one agent to another."""
          pass

      @abstractmethod
      def get_inbox(self, agent_name: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
          """Get pending messages for an agent."""

          """Get parent agent (or None if top-level)."""
          pass

          pass

  def _run_turn_complex(self, state: SimulationState) -> SimulationState:
      # 1. Check for scheduled events
      events = self.event_system.check_triggers(state)
      for event in events:
          state = self.event_system.apply_event(event, state)

      # 2. Update environment (resources, terrain changes)
      state = self.environment.update_environment(state)

      # 3. Multi-phase turn execution
      for phase in self.phase_coordinator.get_phases():
          active_agents = self.phase_coordinator.get_phase_agents(phase, state)

          # 4. Agents observe local state (partial observability)
          for agent in active_agents:

  Example: Economic Simulation with Markets

  # environment.py
  class MarketEnvironment(BaseEnvironment):
      def __init__(self):
          self.order_books = defaultdict(list)  # {good_name: [orders]}

      def get_neighbors(self, agent_name):
          # All agents can trade with each other
          return ["all"]

      def get_local_state(self, agent_name):
          # Agents only see market prices, not full order books
          return {"market_prices": self._get_market_prices()}

  # communication.py
  class MarketProtocol(BaseCommunicationProtocol):
      def send_message(self, sender, receiver, message):
          # For markets, messages are buy/sell orders
          if message["type"] == "order":
              self.environment.order_books[message["good"]].append({
                  "agent": sender,
                  "price": message["price"],
                  "quantity": message["quantity"]
              })

  This would support simulations like:
  - Auction markets with order book matching
  - Supply chains with production networks
  - Urban growth with spatial constraints
  - Epidemics with contact networks
  - Ecosystems with predator-prey dynamics
