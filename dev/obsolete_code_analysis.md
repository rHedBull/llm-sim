# Obsolete Code Analysis

## Files to Remove

### 1. TurnManager (`src/llm_sim/coordinator/turn_manager.py`)

**Status:** OBSOLETE - Safe to remove

**Evidence:**
- Never imported by any file in the codebase
- No test coverage
- Functionality fully duplicated in SimulationCoordinator

**Duplicated Functionality:**
- `TurnManager.execute_turn()` → `SimulationCoordinator._process_turn()`
- Agent action collection → `SimulationCoordinator._collect_agent_actions()`
- Turn phases → Simplified in coordinator's turn processing
- Performance metrics → Captured in TurnResult

**Recommendation:** Delete file entirely

### 2. Related Spec Files
The following spec files reference TurnManager and may need updating:
- `specs/001-a-llm-workfolw/tasks/T024-implement-turn-manager-component.md`
- References in other task files

## Architecture Evolution

The codebase shows evidence of architectural evolution:

1. **Original Design:** Separate components (TurnManager, SimulationCoordinator)
2. **Current Design:** Consolidated into SimulationCoordinator

This consolidation likely happened because:
- Turn management is tightly coupled with simulation coordination
- Reduces complexity and inter-component communication
- Simplifies the execution flow

## Other Potential Obsolete Code

### To Investigate:
1. Check for other unused coordinator components
2. Look for obsolete agent implementations
3. Review old spec files that may reference outdated architecture

## Cleanup Benefits

Removing obsolete code will:
- Reduce confusion for new developers
- Decrease maintenance burden
- Improve code clarity
- Reduce potential for bugs from accidentally using old code

## Action Items

1. **Immediate:** Remove `turn_manager.py`
2. **Follow-up:** Update or archive related spec files
3. **Future:** Regular code audits to identify obsolete code
