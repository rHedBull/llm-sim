# Feature Specification: Dynamic Agent Management

**Feature Branch**: `009-dynamic-agent-management`
**Created**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Dynamic Agent Management - Core Capability: The simulation should support a dynamic number of agents that can change during runtime, rather than having a fixed set of agents throughout the entire simulation. Three Operations: 1. Add agents - New agents can join the simulation at any turn with their own initial state 2. Remove agents - Existing agents can be removed from the simulation permanently 3. Pause/Resume agents - Agents can be temporarily deactivated (keeping their state) and later reactivated. Two Control Mechanisms: Agent-initiated changes and External control."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input

   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-02
- Q: When attempting to add an agent with a duplicate name, what should the system do? ‚Üí A: Auto-rename - append suffix (e.g., "agent_1", "agent_2") and proceed
- Q: How should lifecycle validation failures be reported when an agent-initiated action is rejected? ‚Üí A: Logged warning - record failure, continue turn execution silently
- Q: What constraints should the system enforce on agent lifecycle operations? ‚Üí A: Maximum only - cap total agent count at 25 agents
- Q: Should auto-resume be mandatory or optional when pausing agents? ‚Üí A: Optional - pause can be indefinite or with auto-resume
- Q: What validation rules should apply to agent-initiated lifecycle requests (self-removal, spawning, self-pause)? ‚Üí A: Basic checks only - verify technical feasibility (not at max count, agent exists, etc.)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a simulation researcher, I need to dynamically control the agent population during runtime so that I can:
- Model realistic scenarios where agents join or leave the simulation (births, deaths, migrations)
- Experiment with different agent configurations without restarting the simulation
- Temporarily exclude agents from participation while preserving their state for later analysis
- Test how population changes affect emergent behaviors in the system

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a running simulation with 10 active agents, **When** a researcher adds a new agent with initial state, **Then** the new agent begins participating in subsequent turns with its specified starting conditions
2. **Given** a simulation with active agents, **When** an agent is removed from the simulation, **Then** the agent no longer participates in any future turns and its data is excluded from active agent queries
3. **Given** an active agent in the simulation, **When** the agent is paused, **Then** the agent skips all decision-making turns but retains its current state
4. **Given** a paused agent, **When** the agent is resumed, **Then** the agent resumes normal participation from its preserved state
5. **Given** an agent with self-removal capability, **When** the agent requests its own removal through a lifecycle action, **Then** the agent is removed after basic validation (agent exists, is active)
6. **Given** an agent capable of spawning, **When** the agent requests creation of a new agent and the count is below 25, **Then** the new agent is added after basic validation with the specified initial state
7. **Given** a paused agent with auto-resume configured, **When** the specified number of turns elapse, **Then** the agent automatically resumes participation
8. **Given** multiple agents being added/removed in the same turn, **When** the turn completes, **Then** all lifecycle changes are reflected in the updated state

### Edge Cases
- How does the system handle removal of an agent that is referenced by other agents?
- What happens when an agent attempts to pause itself while it's already paused?
- How does the system handle resume requests for agents that don't exist or were removed?
- What happens when the last remaining agent attempts to remove itself?
- How are lifecycle action conflicts resolved (e.g., agent tries to both spawn and self-remove in same turn)?
- What happens when attempting to add an agent when the 25-agent maximum is already reached?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

- **FR-010**: Lifecycle actions MUST be separated from regular agent actions during turn execution

- **FR-022**: Paused agents MUST retain their complete state while inactive

- **Agent**: Represents a simulation participant with a unique name, state data, and lifecycle status (active, paused, removed)
- **Agent State**: The complete set of data associated with an agent, including custom attributes and configuration
- **Lifecycle Action**: A special type of action representing agent-initiated requests to modify agent population (spawn, self-remove, self-pause)
- **Paused Agent Tracking**: A collection tracking which agents are currently paused and their auto-resume configuration (if any)
