## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a simulation designer, I want to position agents in various spatial topologies (grids, networks, geographic regions) so that I can model location-based interactions, movement constraints, and proximity-based behaviors in my simulations. The spatial features should be optional and not break existing simulations that don't use them.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Grid-based positioning**
1. **Given** a simulation configuration with a 50√ó50 grid topology
2. **When** I configure agents with initial grid positions
3. **Then** each agent exists at a specific grid cell
4. **And** agents can query which other agents are at adjacent cells
5. **And** agents can only move to adjacent grid cells (4-connectivity or 8-connectivity)

**Scenario 2: Geographic region positioning**
1. **Given** a simulation configuration with GeoJSON map regions (e.g., Westeros territories)
2. **When** I place agents in named regions (e.g., "house_stark" in "the_north")
3. **Then** each agent is positioned in their assigned region
4. **And** agents can query which regions are adjacent via shared borders
5. **And** agents can query region attributes (e.g., population, resources, terrain)

**Scenario 3: Multi-layer networks**
1. **Given** a simulation with multiple network layers (borders, rail routes, trade routes)
2. **When** agents query connectivity
3. **Then** agents can navigate different networks independently
4. **And** distance calculations respect the chosen network
5. **And** connection properties vary by network (e.g., rail has speed, borders have defensibility)

**Scenario 4: Partial observability by proximity**
1. **Given** agents positioned in a spatial topology
2. **When** an agent requests state information
3. **Then** the agent sees only nearby agents within a configured radius
4. **And** the agent sees only nearby locations within that radius
5. **And** distant agents and locations are filtered from observation

**Scenario 5: Backward compatibility**
1. **Given** an existing simulation configuration without spatial configuration
2. **When** I run the simulation
3. **Then** the simulation runs normally without spatial features
4. **And** no spatial state is created or maintained
5. **And** agents use existing decision-making without spatial queries

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an agent attempts to move to a non-adjacent location? (Validation should reject invalid moves)
- What happens when querying spatial state in a simulation with no spatial configuration? (Queries return None or empty results gracefully)
- How does the system handle agents with no initial_location in a spatial simulation? (Agent has no position until explicitly placed)
- What happens when GeoJSON file is missing or malformed? (Clear error during configuration validation)
- How does checkpoint restoration work with spatial state? (Spatial state is fully serialized and restored like other state)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **SpatialState**: Represents the complete spatial configuration of the simulation, including topology type, agent positions, location definitions, network definitions, and connection properties. Links to specific topology information (grid parameters, region definitions, etc.).

- **Location**: Represents a position or region in the spatial topology. Has a unique identifier and arbitrary attributes (resources, terrain, population, etc.). Can represent a grid cell, hex cell, graph node, or geographic region depending on topology type.

- **Network**: Represents a layer of connectivity between locations. Has a name (e.g., "borders", "rail_network", "trade_routes") and a set of edges (location pairs). Multiple networks can coexist, allowing multi-layer spatial relationships.

- **Connection**: Represents a link between two locations in a specific network. Has directional information (unidirectional or bidirectional) and arbitrary attributes (speed, capacity, cost, defensibility, etc.). Properties can vary across networks for the same location pair.

- **Agent Position**: Associates an agent (by name) with a location (by identifier). Maintained within SpatialState. Updated through engine mutation operations.
