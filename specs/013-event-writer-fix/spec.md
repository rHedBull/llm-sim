# Feature Specification: EventWriter Synchronous Mode Implementation

**Feature Branch**: `013-event-writer-fix`
**Created**: 2025-10-08
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "event-writer-fix # EventWriter Synchronous Mode Implementation

## Overview

This document provides a detailed implementation plan for adding synchronous write mode to the EventWriter class. This solution addresses the root cause of missing `events.jsonl` files while providing a clean migration path for future microservices architecture.

## Problem Statement

The current EventWriter uses an async background task to write events, but the simulation runs in `_run_turn_sync()` which blocks the event loop, preventing the background task from executing. Events are queued but never written to disk.

## Solution Architecture

### Design Principles

1. **Mode-Based Operation**: Support both async and sync modes in the same class
2. **Zero Breaking Changes**: Existing async code continues to work unchanged
3. **Simple API**: Same `emit()` interface for both modes
4. **Service-Ready**: Easy to migrate to remote event service later
5. **Thread-Safe**: Synchronous mode is safe for future threading models

### Class Architecture

```
EventWriter
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Mode Selection (async/sync)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Async Path (existing)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Queue-based buffering
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Background _write_loop()
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Graceful shutdown with flush
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Sync Path (new)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Direct file writes
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Immediate flush
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Synchronous rotation

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
**As a** simulation operator
**I want** events from simulation runs to be reliably persisted to disk
**So that** I can review, analyze, and debug simulation behavior through the event log after the simulation completes

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a simulation is configured to record events, **When** the simulation runs to completion, **Then** all generated events MUST be written to an event file on disk

2. **Given** the event writer is operating in synchronous mode, **When** an event is emitted, **Then** the event MUST be immediately written and flushed to disk before control returns to the caller

3. **Given** the event writer is operating in asynchronous mode, **When** an event is emitted, **Then** the event MUST be queued and written by a background task without blocking the caller

4. **Given** an event file reaches its maximum size threshold, **When** a new event is emitted, **Then** the system MUST rotate the current file to a timestamped archive file and start a new current event file

5. **Given** the simulation completes or stops, **When** the event writer is shut down, **Then** all pending events MUST be written to disk before shutdown completes (async mode) or already be written (sync mode)

6. **Given** the simulation uses blocking synchronous execution contexts, **When** the event writer mode is configured, **Then** the system MUST default to or use synchronous mode to ensure events are written despite blocked event loops

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the disk is full and an event cannot be written?
  - System MUST log an error indicating the write failure and the specific event that failed

- What happens when the event file rotation fails (e.g., file permissions issue)?
  - System MUST log a rotation failure error and continue writing to the current file if possible

- What happens when the event queue is full in async mode?
  - System MUST drop the event and increment a dropped event counter, logging a warning periodically

- What happens when multiple events are emitted faster than disk write speed in sync mode?
  - System MUST block on each write, ensuring durability at the cost of performance (documented trade-off)

- What happens when the simulation is interrupted or crashes?
  - In sync mode: all events up to the interruption point MUST be on disk
  - In async mode: queued events may be lost (documented limitation)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST support two operational modes for event writing: synchronous and asynchronous
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow configuration of the event writer mode at initialization time
- **FR-003**: In synchronous mode, system MUST write each event immediately to disk and flush all OS buffers before returning control
- **FR-004**: In asynchronous mode, system MUST queue events and write them via a background task without blocking event emission
- **FR-005**: System MUST filter events based on verbosity level before writing
- **FR-006**: System MUST rotate event files when they exceed a configurable maximum file size
- **FR-007**: System MUST create timestamped archive filenames during rotation to prevent collisions
- **FR-008**: System MUST ensure output directory exists before attempting to write events
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain a running count of the current event file size for rotation decisions
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide graceful shutdown that ensures all events are written before termination
- **FR-011**: System MUST log event writer lifecycle events (initialization, start, stop, rotation, errors)
- **FR-012**: System MUST count and report dropped events in async mode when queue is full
- **FR-013**: System MUST serialize events to JSON format with newline delimiters (JSONL)
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle write errors gracefully by logging the error and identifying the failed event
- **FR-015**: Synchronous mode MUST guarantee event persistence by flushing to disk on every write
- **FR-016**: Asynchronous mode start operation MUST be a no-op when in synchronous mode
- **FR-017**: Asynchronous mode stop operation MUST be a no-op when in synchronous mode (events already written)
- **FR-018**: System MUST expose a consistent `emit()` interface regardless of selected mode
- **FR-019**: System MUST default to a mode appropriate for the execution context [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should default be sync or async? User spec suggests sync for reliability]

### Key Entities

- **Event**: A simulation occurrence to be recorded, consisting of event type, simulation ID, timestamp, and event-specific data
- **Event File**: The current active file receiving event writes (events.jsonl)
- **Rotated Event File**: An archived event file with a timestamped filename (events_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS-ffffff.jsonl)
- **Event Writer Mode**: The operational mode (synchronous or asynchronous) determining write behavior
- **Event Queue**: A buffer for events awaiting asynchronous write (async mode only)
- **Verbosity Level**: A filter determining which event types should be written based on importance
- **Write Metrics**: Statistics tracking total events written, bytes written, errors, rotations, and latency
