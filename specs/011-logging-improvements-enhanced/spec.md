- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer running simulations, I need logging output that:
1. Automatically includes context (simulation ID, component name, agent ID) so I can trace events
2. Displays readable, color-coded console output during development
3. Produces structured JSON logs for production deployments
4. Accepts correlation IDs from external systems (like API servers) so I can trace requests end-to-end

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a simulation is running, **When** any component logs an event, **Then** the log output includes the simulation ID, component name, and timestamp automatically without manual effort

2. **Given** an agent is making decisions, **When** the agent logs events, **Then** all log entries automatically include the agent's identifier

3. **Given** development mode is enabled, **When** logs are written, **Then** output appears in the console with color coding (errors in red, warnings in yellow, info in cyan) and aligned formatting

4. **Given** production mode is enabled, **When** logs are written, **Then** output is in JSON format with all context fields included

5. **Given** an external system (server) starts a simulation, **When** the system provides a correlation ID, **Then** all simulation logs include that correlation ID for tracing

6. **Given** multiple simulations run concurrently, **When** reviewing logs, **Then** each simulation's logs can be filtered separately by its unique ID

7. **Given** a turn starts or ends, **When** the orchestrator logs the event, **Then** the log includes counts of active agents and paused agents

8. **Given** an agent begins deciding an action, **When** the agent logs this activity, **Then** the start and completion of decision-making is recorded with timing information

### Edge Cases
- What happens when context binding fails during logger initialization? ‚Üí System falls back to logging without context, warning is emitted
- How does the system handle missing correlation IDs from external systems? ‚Üí Logs proceed without correlation ID, no errors occur
- What happens if console color rendering is unsupported (e.g., non-TTY output)? ‚Üí Colors are automatically disabled, plain text is used
- How are nested async operations handled with context? ‚Üí Context automatically propagates through async operations using context variables

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Core Logging Configuration**
- **FR-001**: System MUST support configuring logging with an initial context dictionary that binds to all loggers
- **FR-002**: System MUST return a configured logger instance from the logging setup function
- **FR-003**: System MUST support both JSON and human-readable console output formats
- **FR-004**: System MUST automatically detect output format based on environment (development vs production)

**Context Binding**
- **FR-005**: Logger instances MUST support binding context key-value pairs that persist across all log calls from that instance
- **FR-006**: Simulation orchestrator MUST bind simulation ID and simulation name to its logger instance automatically
- **FR-007**: Agent components MUST bind their agent ID to their logger instances automatically
- **FR-008**: Infrastructure components MUST bind their component identifier to their logger instances
- **FR-009**: Context MUST automatically propagate through asynchronous operations without manual passing

**External Correlation**
- **FR-010**: Orchestrator MUST accept an optional log_context parameter containing external correlation data
- **FR-011**: External correlation data MUST merge with all simulation logs automatically
- **FR-012**: System MUST support correlation IDs, request IDs, user IDs, and custom fields from external systems

**Console Output Enhancement**
- **FR-013**: Console output MUST display logs with color coding by severity level (error=red, warning=yellow, info=cyan, debug=gray)
- **FR-014**: Console output MUST align event names and key-value pairs for readability
- **FR-015**: Console output MUST include component name showing which module logged the event
- **FR-016**: Console output MUST format timestamps in a human-readable format
- **FR-017**: Color rendering MUST automatically disable when output is redirected or non-TTY

**Module Standardization**
- **FR-018**: All modules MUST acquire loggers using the module name identifier for hierarchical logging
- **FR-019**: System MUST display module hierarchy in logs (e.g., llm_sim.orchestrator, llm_sim.infrastructure.events)

**Enhanced Operation Logging**
- **FR-020**: Turn boundary events MUST include context about active agent count and paused agent count
- **FR-021**: Agent decision-making MUST log start and completion events with timing information
- **FR-022**: Lifecycle events MUST include reason or trigger information when available
- **FR-023**: State change events MUST include component context automatically

**Production Readiness**
- **FR-024**: JSON output MUST include all context fields (simulation_id, component, agent_id, etc.) in every log record
- **FR-025**: Logs MUST be self-describing with all necessary fields for filtering and searching
- **FR-026**: System MUST support external log aggregation systems through structured JSON output

### Key Entities

- **Logger Instance**: Represents a configured logging object with bound context that persists across all log calls. Contains context like simulation_id, component, agent_id
- **Log Context**: Dictionary of key-value pairs that provide tracing and debugging information (run_id, request_id, simulation_name, component, agent_id)
- **Log Record**: Individual log event containing timestamp, severity level, event name, bound context, and additional event-specific data
- **External Context**: Correlation data provided by external systems (API servers) to enable end-to-end request tracing across system boundaries
