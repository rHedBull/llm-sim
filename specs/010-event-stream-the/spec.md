# Feature Specification: Event Stream Activity Logging

**Feature Branch**: `010-event-stream-the`
**Created**: 2025-10-04
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "event-stream       The event stream enhancement adds fine-grained activity logging to simulations, capturing every significant action between checkpoint snapshots.

  What Gets Captured:
  - Agent decisions and actions (investments, policy changes, strategic moves)
  - State variable transitions (economic indicators changing, resource levels updating)
  - Inter-agent interactions (trades, communications, conflicts)
  - System events (validation failures, LLM API calls, retry attempts)
  - Causality links showing what triggered each change

  Data Storage:
  The llm-sim framework writes a single events.jsonl file in each simulation's output directory, appending events as they occur during the simulation run.

  Server Capabilities:
  The API server discovers these event files, exposes an endpoint to retrieve events, and supports filtering by time range, event type, specific agents, or turn numbers.

  Visualization Benefits:
  The UI can display detailed timelines, filter event streams by criteria, show causality chains explaining state changes, animate simulation playback, and provide audit trails for debugging or analysis.

  Architecture Philosophy:
  This is a simple file-based approach suitable for small-to-medium simulations, avoiding infrastructure complexity while enabling rich observability. If scale demands it later, the same data could migrate to a
  proper time-series database.
  this must be integrated at import parts of the existing code. there should be information levels. like TURN,   - MILESTONE - Turn boundaries, phase transitions, major outcomes
  - DECISION - Agent strategic choices, policy changes
  - ACTION - Individual agent actions, transactions
  - STATE - Variable changes, resource updates
  - DETAIL - Granular calculations, intermediate values  and the deepest level of wanted event streaming configurable"

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04
- Q: What should be the default verbosity level when no level is explicitly configured for a simulation? ‚Üí A: ACTION - Captures turn milestones, decisions, and individual actions (balanced observability)
- Q: How should the system handle event file size limits during long-running simulations? ‚Üí A: Rotation at 500MB - Create timestamped files (events_2025-10-04_14-30.jsonl)
- Q: What should happen to event files when a simulation output directory is deleted or archived? ‚Üí A: Delete with output directory - Events tied to simulation lifecycle, no separate retention
- Q: How should the system handle event write failures when the logging system cannot keep up with event generation rate? ‚Üí A: Drop events - Continue simulation, log warning (maintains simulation speed, loses data)
- Q: How should causality links be represented when a single event triggers multiple simultaneous consequences? ‚Üí A: One-to-many array - Source event ID stored in array field on each consequence
- Q: What metadata fields should be REQUIRED in every JSONL event entry (beyond timestamp and turn_number)? ‚Üí A: event_id, timestamp, turn_number, event_type, simulation_id, agent_id (optional), caused_by (optional array)
- Q: Should the event-specific payload (beyond required metadata) follow a standardized schema or be flexible per event type? ‚Üí A: Hybrid - Common fields defined (e.g., "description", "details"), plus type-specific optional fields

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a simulation researcher or analyst, I need to understand what happened during a simulation run at varying levels of detail. Between checkpoint snapshots, many significant events occur that are currently invisible. The event stream gives me a complete activity log showing every agent decision, state change, interaction, and system event, allowing me to debug issues, analyze causality chains, and replay simulations step-by-step.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a simulation is running, **When** an agent makes a strategic decision (e.g., changes investment policy), **Then** the event stream captures the decision with timestamp, agent identifier, decision type, and causal context.

2. **Given** a simulation has completed, **When** I request events filtered by a specific agent, **Then** the API returns only events involving that agent in chronological order.

3. **Given** a simulation is running with MILESTONE verbosity, **When** a turn boundary is crossed, **Then** only turn transitions and major outcomes are logged, not individual agent actions.

4. **Given** a simulation is running with DETAIL verbosity, **When** a state variable changes, **Then** the event stream captures the old value, new value, triggering action, and intermediate calculations.

5. **Given** multiple simulations have completed, **When** I query the API for a specific simulation's events, **Then** the server discovers and returns events from the correct events.jsonl file.

6. **Given** event filtering by turn number range, **When** I request events from turns 5-10, **Then** only events occurring within that turn range are returned.

7. **Given** event filtering by event type, **When** I request only DECISION events, **Then** the response excludes all ACTION, STATE, and DETAIL events.

8. **Given** an LLM API call fails and retries, **When** the system event occurs, **Then** the event stream captures the failure, retry attempt count, and eventual outcome.

9. **Given** two agents interact (e.g., trade or conflict), **When** the interaction occurs, **Then** the event stream links both agents and captures the bidirectional relationship.

10. **Given** a UI timeline visualization, **When** displaying events, **Then** users can filter by criteria, follow causality chains, and animate playback through the simulation.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the event file reaches 500MB during simulation execution?
- How does the system handle write failures to the event file during simulation execution?
- What happens if events are generated faster than the logging system can write them?
- How is the user notified when events are being dropped due to write backlog?
- How are causality arrays structured when a single event has multiple triggering sources?
- What happens if the API server encounters a corrupted events.jsonl file?
- How does filtering perform on very large event streams (millions of events)?
- What happens when events from parallel agent actions need timestamps with sub-millisecond precision?

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Event**: Represents a single significant occurrence during simulation execution. Required fields: event_id (unique identifier), timestamp (ISO 8601 format), turn_number (integer), event_type (MILESTONE/DECISION/ACTION/STATE/DETAIL), simulation_id (simulation identifier). Optional standard fields: agent_id (present for agent-specific events, absent for system events), caused_by (array of event_id values indicating causality sources). Common payload fields: description (human-readable summary), details (structured data object). Type-specific optional fields vary by event type (e.g., state changes include old_value/new_value, decisions include decision_type).

- **Causality Link**: Represents the relationship between triggering events and resulting events. Implemented as an array field on each event containing one or more source event identifiers that caused this event to occur.

- **Event Stream**: The complete chronological sequence of events for a simulation run. Stored as a single JSONL file with one event per line.

- **Event Filter**: Criteria used to retrieve a subset of events. Contains optional time range (start/end timestamps), event type list, agent identifier list, and turn number range.
