# Implementation Plan Template

## Constitution Check
- ✅ KISS Principle: Is this the simplest solution?
- ✅ DRY Principle: Are we reusing existing components?
- ✅ No Legacy Support: Are we making clean transitions without compatibility layers?
- ✅ Test-First Development: Will tests be written before implementation?
- ✅ Clean Interface Design: Are interfaces explicit and composable?
- ✅ Observability: Will components provide clear logging and errors?

## Feature Overview
[Brief description of the feature/change]

## Design Approach

### Simplicity Analysis
- Current complexity level: [Low/Medium/High]
- Justification for any complexity: [If not Low, explain why]
- Simpler alternatives considered: [List any rejected simpler approaches]

### Reusability Check
- Existing components to reuse: [List components]
- New components that will be reusable: [List components]
- Duplication being eliminated: [List any consolidation]

## Implementation Steps

1. [Step following KISS principle]
2. [Step following DRY principle]
3. [Additional steps as needed]

## Validation Criteria
- [ ] No code duplication introduced
- [ ] Solution is understandable without extensive documentation
- [ ] Existing patterns and utilities are reused
- [ ] Complexity is justified and documented

## Risk Assessment
- Complexity risks: [Any areas violating KISS]
- Duplication risks: [Any areas violating DRY]
- Mitigation strategies: [How to address risks]
