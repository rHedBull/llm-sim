# Feature Specification Template

## Constitution Alignment
- **KISS Compliance**: [How this spec ensures simplicity]
- **DRY Compliance**: [How this spec promotes reusability]
- **No Legacy Support**: [How this spec ensures clean transitions]
- **Test-First Development**: [How tests will drive implementation]
- **Clean Interface Design**: [How interfaces will be explicit and composable]
- **Observability**: [How components will provide debugging support]

## Scope

### What's Included
- [Feature adhering to simplicity principle]
- [Feature promoting code reuse]

### What's Excluded
- [Complex features deferred for simplicity]
- [Duplicate functionality avoided]

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. [Simple, clear requirement]
2. [Requirement that leverages existing components]

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Simplicity**: Solution must be understandable by junior developers
- **Maintainability**: No duplicated logic or configuration
- **Testability**: Simple enough to test with minimal setup

## Design Constraints

### Mandatory Simplicity Rules
- Maximum function complexity: Cyclomatic complexity â‰¤ 5
- Maximum class hierarchy depth: 3 levels
- Maximum file length: 200 lines
- Maximum function length: 30 lines

### Mandatory Reusability Rules
- Must use existing state management system
- Must follow established patterns in codebase
- Must extract common logic into shared modules
- Must centralize configuration

## Success Criteria
1. Implementation passes KISS review (no unnecessary complexity)
2. Implementation passes DRY review (no duplication)
3. Code review confirms adherence to constitution
4. Tests are simple and comprehensive

## Technical Decisions

### Simplicity Choices
- [Technology/pattern chosen for simplicity]
- [What complex alternatives were rejected]

### Reusability Choices
- [Existing components being reused]
- [New reusable components being created]
